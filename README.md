# arctrack
Analytics layer for Arc partner sites in PageBuilder

## Description
Arctrack is a Node-based data layer library aimed at simplifying client-side analytics build-outs. It works by seeding an application with different types of action listeners that can respond to general or fine-tuned user actions.

The term _action listener_ is used instead of _event listener_ to describe a broad set of possible contexts in which you might want to dispatch a callback, instead of _only_ DOM event listeners. For example, Arctrack is set up to track individual functions in your JavaScript, in addition to browser events that are commonly listened to, such as scrolling, clicking, etc.
